      "The 'Skills over Degrees' initiative refers to a talent strategy where organizations prioritize hiring individuals based on their skills rather than their educational background. IBM is one of the major companies that has been well-documented for implementing this approach. This shift towards skills-based hiring is driven by the increasing demand for in-demand skills and the need for companies to stay competitive in the market. Additionally, technology can help light the way for employees to assess their skills portfolio against market needs and choose the right upskilling opportunities. However, many companies face challenges in tracking the availability of internal and external skills, making it essential to invest in tools and technologies that enable easy updates and collaboration on skills taxonomies.Based on the information provided in the text, 45% of companies report that their need for in-demand skills is higher than for other skills. This makes talent search and retention even more challenging as these skills are in high demand both within and outside the organization. Companies need to develop a pay for skills capability to remain competitive and attract and retain top talent with the necessary skills. The emergence of AI-powered talent intelligence platforms provides an opportunity to match the supply of talent to the demand for work based on skills, aspirations, and availability. Additionally, skills are increasingly impacting pay, and companies need to understand what skills are commanding the most pay in the external market to remain competitive.\n",

However, traditional pay for performance approaches are not going away completely, but rather should be aligned with an organization's overall rewards and talent strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pay for skills can revolutionize the way workers are paid in some organizations or represent an opportunity to supplement existing rewards programs in others. The implementation of skills-based pay practices often involves creating a skills taxonomy and defining proficiency scales, which enables objective and fair deployment of skills-based pay. Despite the benefits, only 47% of companies have formal skills-based rewards in place to recognize ongoing skill development.\n",

This implies that while there is a growing recognition of the importance of skills in the hiring process, the operationalization of skills-based compensation remains a challenge for many organizations. The lack of formal skills-based rewards also has the potential to create equity gaps over time, particularly for those companies that do factor skills into pay at the time of hire."

      "In a talent marketplace, skills serve as the primary currency for matching demand (for work) and supply (of talent). This approach is based on the understanding that jobs and their pre-defined career paths are no longer sufficient to meet the evolving needs of businesses and employees. Instead, organizations focus on the skills required to perform specific tasks or projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of skills as a currency in talent marketplaces disrupts traditional talent management practices by enabling greater agility, flexibility, and resilience. Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Strategic workforce planning: Organizations can apply internal and external supply and demand skills research data for enhanced insights and redefined talent/skills pools. This allows them to respond quickly to evolving business needs and make informed decisions about the skills they need to acquire or develop.\n",
      "2. Reskilling and upskilling: Talent marketplaces enable organizations to conduct rapid reskilling without laborious current state analysis, ensuring that their workforce remains equipped with the necessary skills to meet changing business demands.\n",
      "3. Pay-for-skills: Investing in future skills and reinventing pay programs based on skill demand, supply, and criticality enables organizations to attract and retain top talent more effectively. This approach also ensures that employees are compensated fairly for their skills and contributions.\n",
      "4. Performance engagement: Talent marketplaces enable employees to engage with work in new ways, such as gig, part-time, or project-based work. This disrupts traditional approaches to talent management by allowing organizations to tap into a broader pool of talent and enabling employees to build their skills and gain diverse experiences.\n",
      "5. Internal talent marketplace: Deconstructing work into tasks and turning them into attractive projects allows internal talent to connect seamlessly, leading to increased participation, reduced talent hoarding, and higher sponsorship from business leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the use of skills as a currency in talent marketplaces enables organizations to match demand and supply more effectively while disrupting traditional talent management practices by enabling greater agility, flexibility, and resilience.One primary use case for starting a talent marketplace within an organization is to unlock trapped capacity or productivity. This means identifying and leveraging the skills and expertise of underutilized employees, and matching them with projects or initiatives where their talents are needed. By creating a platform that allows employees to showcase their skills and availability, and for managers to view this information in real-time, organizations can more efficiently allocate resources and optimize workforce utilization. This not only leads to increased productivity but also provides opportunities for professional development and career growth for employees. Additionally, it can help reduce the need for external hiring, saving costs and improving overall talent retention.Technology platforms have played a significant role in democratizing career development opportunities and enabling a philosophy of utilizing talent across the organization, particularly through talent marketplaces. These platforms have started by supporting \"gig\" work that addresses immediate business needs but also allow employees to express their skills and passions in different areas, own their careers, pursue opportunities aligned with their aspirations, and access work that's meaningful to them (Building and sustaining a thriving talent marketplace, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the primary ways technology platforms enhance the value of talent marketplaces is by providing career development and mobility opportunities for employees. By using skills as the currency in these marketplaces, organizations can match demand for work with the supply of available talent based on their skills. This approach promotes internal mobility and diversity of thinking and experiences across the organization (Building and sustaining a thriving talent marketplace, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, technology platforms offer additional features beyond matching demand and supply, such as workforce intelligence and career pathing. These features help organizations introduce managers and HR professionals to skills as a decision factor in staffing, recruitment, and job architecture (Building and sustaining a thriving talent marketplace, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way technology platforms add value is by enabling new ways of working that equalize the playing field for all employees. By deconstructing work into tasks and turning them into attractive projects, organizations can create opportunities for underutilized skills to be deployed in new contexts (Building and sustaining a thriving talent marketplace, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, technology platforms help organizations respond quickly to evolving business needs while increasing diversity of thinking and innovation. As more companies adopt talent marketplaces, they are starting to reach out to external candidates and company alumni, expanding the pool of available talent (Building and sustaining a thriving talent marketplace, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, technology platforms have become essential tools for organizations looking to create thriving talent marketplaces. By providing career development opportunities, enabling new ways of working, and matching demand with supply based on skills, these platforms help organizations respond quickly to evolving business needs while promoting diversity of thinking and innovation.Change management is considered the biggest challenge in implementing and sustaining a talent marketplace due to several reasons. Firstly, a talent marketplace significantly impacts ways of working, teaming, performance management, and other talent practices, fundamentally changing organizational alignment and people's roles within it. Secondly, many organizations have historical top-down waterfall approaches that require extensive calibration from the onset, making change management more complex and time-consuming.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this challenge, organizations must focus on change management as the most critical factor in determining a talent marketplace's success. This includes building awareness of the talent marketplace, developing user experience and advocacy, and realizing business benefits. HR plays a crucial role in this process by setting guidelines and context for change, advising leaders and managers, and enabling the movement and flow of talent with the right processes, governance, technology, and change management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, organizations can help set up their talent marketplace for success by sustaining momentum through learning, evolving, adapting, and communicating clearly with stakeholders. They must find the sweet spot where the needs of the business, managers, and employees overlap to ensure successful adoption. This necessitates being innovative about how work is designed, organized, and executed, and how talent flows to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, change management is a significant challenge in implementing and sustaining a talent marketplace due to its far-reaching impact on organizational structures and people's roles. However, by focusing on change management as a critical success factor, organizations can address this challenge and reap the benefits of a thriving and sustainable talent marketplace."

This change enables organizations to create a more robust internal talent marketplace, optimize compensation packages, and attract and retain critical skills.Organizations are transitioning to a skills-based approach in various ways. They start by piloting this approach within a subset of their organization, focusing on specific unmet skills-related needs or current successes that can be optimized. This allows them to develop use cases around these successes or needs and embed the employee and digital experience into these use cases. By doing so, they diminish (or eliminate) the silos within their processes across the employee journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, organizations are building a business case for this transition by identifying problems that can be addressed through skills-based practices, quantifying potential impacts, and prioritizing opportunities where near-term ROI can be demonstrated. They recognize the importance of having a foundational infrastructure to support effective skills-based hiring and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text also suggests that leading organizations have already made significant progress in developing company-relevant skills taxonomies, which are essential for operationalizing their skills-based strategies. Overall, the transition to a skills-based approach involves breaking down silos, focusing on employee needs and successes, and building a strong foundation for skills development and hiring.Moving towards a skills-based work architecture offers several benefits for organizations and their employees. Some of these benefits include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Flexible, agile workforce: A skills-based approach allows organizations to match the right talent with the right projects or gigs based on their skills rather than job titles. This leads to a more flexible and agile workforce that can adapt quickly to changing business needs.\n",
      "2. Reduced turnover: By focusing on skills development and career growth, employees are more engaged and motivated, leading to lower turnover rates.\n",
      "3. Robust internal talent marketplace: A skills-based approach creates a robust internal talent marketplace where employees can easily discover new opportunities based on their skills and interests.\n",
      "4. More effective, efficient hiring processes: By assessing candidates based on their skills rather than job titles or degrees, organizations can make more informed hiring decisions and reduce the time and cost of recruitment.\n",
      "5. Optimized compensation packages: A skills-based approach allows organizations to offer more equitable and transparent compensation packages based on the value of specific skills rather than job titles.\n",
      "6. Increased productivity: By focusing on developing employees' skills, organizations can increase productivity and innovation.\n",
      "7. Realize cost savings: By leveraging internal talent and reducing the need for external recruitment, organizations can save costs associated with hiring and training new employees.\n",
      "8. Career/learning culture: A skills-based approach fosters a culture of continuous learning and development, which is essential in today's rapidly changing business environment.\n",
      "9. Improved workforce planning: By incorporating a skills taxonomy into job architecture, organizations can better plan for future talent needs and make more informed decisions about talent assessment, development, and flexible talent pools.Most organizations find it challenging to shift from traditional job-based structures to a skills-based model due to several reasons. Some of the primary barriers include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Complexity and change management: Implementing a skills-based approach requires significant change management efforts, as it involves deconstructing jobs into units of skill and redefining work processes accordingly. This can be a complex undertaking that requires careful planning and execution.\n",
      "2. Lack of formal skills assessment and rewards: While organizations may recognize the importance of skills in the hiring process, they often fail to implement formal skills-based reward strategies to recognize ongoing skill development. This can make it difficult for employees to see the value in investing in their skills.\n",
      "3. Resistance to change: Employees and managers may be resistant to the shift from job-based structures to a skills-based model, as they may feel that their roles or responsibilities are not clearly defined or valued under the new system. This can lead to confusion and resistance, making it difficult for the organization to fully adopt the new approach.\n",
      "4. Lack of technology and universal skills taxonomies: Implementing a skills-based approach requires the use of technology and universal skills taxonomies to assess and manage skills effectively. However, many organizations do not have access to these tools or may be hesitant to invest in them due to cost or other considerations.\n",
      "5. Performance-driven culture: Organizations that place a strong emphasis on performance may find it challenging to shift to a skills-based model, as they may view skills development as a secondary concern. However, successful skills-based practices have shown that investing in skills can support long-term profitability and help organizations tap into universal skills taxonomies and technologies to attract, build, and retain critical skills."

Use cases also provide a clear focus for the initial deployment of talent marketplaces, which can help minimize disruption and increase the chances of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "By starting with a use case, organizations can address a specific business problem or unmet skills-related need, which can lead to quick wins and early adopters. This approach also enables the organization to learn from the experience and apply those lessons to future deployments. As more use cases are addressed, the organization can expand its focus to more complex and disruptive areas, such as workforce planning, projects and gigs, and work design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, developing use cases around successes or needs helps ensure that the talent marketplace is aligned with the evolving roles of employees, leaders, managers, and HR stakeholders. This alignment is essential for creating a sustainable talent marketplace and maximizing its benefits for both the organization and its people.Putting the employee experience at the heart of your plan is crucial when adopting an agile approach to talent practices because it helps organizations identify and care for connections to all processes across the employee journey. This approach diminishes or eliminates the silo mentality that has long plagued organizations, enabling a more integrated and effective talent management strategy. By focusing on the employee experience, organizations can create a skills-focused culture that flows throughout the company and is embedded in its talent management processes. This not only benefits employees by encouraging skill development and career growth but also enhances business agility through flexible deployment of talent. Additionally, it enables HR to act as arbitrators of conflict management, enabling the movement and flow of talent with the right processes, governance, technology, and change management. Ultimately, a skills-based approach to talent practices requires a continual focus on learning, both for the organization and its employees, and putting the employee experience at the heart of the plan is essential to making this vision a reality.An agile, needs-based approach to developing skills-based talent practices offers several advantages over traditional top-down waterfall methods. By focusing on specific unmet skills needs or current successes that can be optimized, organizations can more effectively respond to dynamic business requirements and employee development needs. This approach also diminishes the need for extensive change management efforts, as it allows for a more iterative and flexible process.\n",

      "As HR evolves its role from a traditional service delivery role of matching and selecting talent to strategically architecting talent retention, development, and growth in a sustainable and scalable manner, it is essential to address the needs and evolving roles of employees, leaders, managers, and HR stakeholders to ensure a sustainable talent marketplace.The major European energy and automation company democratized, digitalized, and equalized the candidate experience by deploying an \"Open Talent Market,\" which empowers colleagues to choose roles and opportunities based on their career development needs. This talent marketplace is transparent and open, allowing individuals to become a talent orchestrator without requiring approvals, minimum tenure, or performance requirements. The company also established new ways of working by making internal and external candidate experiences truly democratized, digitalized, and equalized. By prioritizing development, increasing access to opportunities, creating greater transparency and flexibility for employees, and enabling leaders to dynamically source talent, the company built new skills for the future while addressing its people's aspirations. This shift towards a thriving talent marketplace has enabled the organization to keep a live, updated view of staffing and skills insights, see availability, needs, staffing, gaps, and upskilling across projects, and reduce the costs of external hiring.A global consumer goods company implemented a talent marketplace to prioritize development, increase access to opportunities, and balance business and employee benefits. The talent marketplace allowed employees to experiment with new roles, try different projects, and raise their hands for aspirational opportunities without fear of retaliation or failure. This approach not only met the needs of the business by providing a live, updated view of staffing and skills insights but also addressed the needs of employees by offering them the chance to grow and develop within the organization.\n",

Overall, the global consumer goods company was able to balance business and employee benefits through its talent marketplace by focusing on the sweet spot where their needs overlapped and creating a culture of experimentation, growth, and development for its employees.The large global insurer faced a significant business need during the pandemic, which required moving internal talent into key roles to ensure the organization could keep up with market demands. In response to this challenge, the insurer began deconstructing jobs into tasks and creating more efficiencies in matching the right skills to tasks (Mercer, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach allowed the insurer to quickly adapt to the changing workforce landscape brought about by the pandemic. The company recognized that many skills had become obsolete or were no longer in demand, while others had gained significant value. To address this issue, the insurer focused on mobilizing its existing talent supply to meet business demands and plotting pathways for redeployment from those at risk of displacement (Mercer, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "The insurer also recognized the importance of creating a culture that values skill development and aligns with compensation and rewards strategies. To achieve this goal, the company developed a testable pilot program and scalable strategy for longer-term success, curated a change management and communication strategy for leadership socialization and program rollout, and increased incentives for skill development within its workforce (Mercer, 2021).\n",

      "Based on the data provided in the text, approximately 48% of companies view skills-based pay as important or very important for optimal compensation plans.The primary objective for the majority of companies (80%) when linking rewards to skills is attraction and retention. This means that these companies are using skills-based pay systems as a tool to attract and retain top talent, particularly in specialized and in-demand roles. By offering higher compensation for employees who possess valuable skills, organizations can differentiate their pay packages and make themselves more competitive in the job market. Additionally, by incentivizing skill development and career progression, companies can foster a culture of continuous learning and growth among their workforce.Based on the data provided in the text, companies differentiate rewards for specific skills in several ways. The most common way is by differentiating rewards for hard skills, which are the most frequently identified skills upon which reward differentiation occurs (40%). Companies also differentiate rewards for leadership skills (33%), soft skills (24%), and qualifications (24%).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the text suggests that there is a significant number of companies (46%) that do not differentiate rewards for specific skills at all. Instead, they use a one-size-fits-all approach to rewarding employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "To differentiate rewards for specific skills effectively, companies can use tools like Skills Pricer, which uses machine learning and industry-leading data sources to analyze the crucial skills that drive pay, the monetary value for each skill, and relevance and demand information for a job. This data can help organizations identify the skills that are important and the premium they command, enabling them to design more effective compensation strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, companies can use skills assessments and continuous performance management to identify and reward employees who possess critical skills or demonstrate exceptional performance in those areas. By doing so, they can pre-emptively address skill shortages and retain high-performing employees, ultimately improving their overall business results.Approximately half (47%) of companies report that they are yet to develop an approach to classifying skills. This is a minimal change since 2021. The lack of maturity in forming a comprehensive perspective on what makes up a desirable, manageable and meaningful number of skills per job suggests that many companies are still at the early stages of implementing skills-based pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance of skills-based pay is driven by the need to attract and retain premium skills. Companies recognize that they must increase pay for skills across the employee life cycle to deliver on this objective. However, the implementation of skills-based rewards programs remains a minority practice, with 83% of companies yet to implement them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this, there is optimism about opportunities in this area, and the objectives for linking rewards to skills include attracting and retaining premium skills (84%) and incentivizing skill development (65%). Companies are prioritizing technical functions for skill mapping, suggesting prioritization of critical roles and specialized skill sets within a company.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, less than a third acknowledge that they indirectly reward for skill development through career progression (29%) and salary progression (28%). To deliver on the primary objective of attracting and retaining critical skills, employers must increase pay for skills across the employee life cycle. Pay for skills can take various forms, including merit increases, promotions, sign-on bonuses, and spot awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the shift towards a skills-based approach to compensation is gaining momentum, but there are still barriers to implementation. Companies recognize the need for skills-based pay to remain competitive in the war for talent, but they face challenges in operationalizing this approach across the organization. The development of an effective skills taxonomy and the linking of rewards to skills are critical steps towards implementing a successful skills-based compensation strategy.\n",

      "In the context of skills-based pay, a proficiency scale plays a crucial role in ensuring that the assessment and compensation of employees' skills are objective and fair. A proficiency scale defines the expected level of mastery for each skill, enabling organizations to differentiate between various levels of competency or expertise. This is essential as it allows for the creation of a transparent and data-driven approach to pay, where employees can see what skills are valued and how their development contributes to their compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, proficiency scales help in aligning pay with market insights and industry standards, ensuring that organizations remain competitive in attracting and retaining talent. They also facilitate the comparison of skills across departments and employees, making it easier for organizations to identify skill gaps and opportunities for growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, developing a proficiency scale can be complex as each organization's framework is unique, and there is no market-dominant structure. Additionally, assessment tools would need to be highly configured or even custom built to tie in with the proficiency scales effectively. Despite these challenges, the benefits of skills-based pay and proficiency scales make it a worthwhile investment for organizations looking to create a fairer approach to compensation and incentivize skill development.Defining the expected proficiency level of a skill for each role is crucial for ensuring that skills-based pay is deployed in a fair manner. This process enables organizations to create objective and transparent salary structures based on employees' demonstrated competencies rather than subjective performance evaluations or seniority. By establishing clear expectations around the required skill level for each role, companies can ensure that all employees are being compensated fairly based on their individual abilities and contributions to the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, a well-defined proficiency scale allows for consistent evaluation of skills across the workforce, reducing potential biases and ensuring that pay decisions are data-driven rather than influenced by personal factors or assumptions. This objective approach not only fosters fairness but also helps organizations maintain a competitive edge in attracting and retaining top talent by offering market-aligned compensation based on demonstrated skill levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, defining the expected proficiency level of skills for each role is an essential component of a successful skills-based pay strategy as it promotes fairness, transparency, and data-driven decision making while ensuring that employees are being compensated based on their individual abilities and contributions to the organization.Based on the data presented in the 2023/2024 Skills Snapshot Survey Report, 76% of the respondents with a skills taxonomy have a defined proficiency scale. This suggests that having a clear and defined proficiency scale is a priority for organizations implementing skills-based transformations. It enables them to compare skills across departments and employees, and apply formalized proficiency levels to various talent practices. However, there is no market-dominant structure for proficiency frameworks, as each organization's proficiency scales are unique.An objective process to assess each employee's skill proficiency is crucial in the context of skills-based pay because it enables the deployment of skills-based pay in a fair and objective manner. When done right, this approach can lead to increased transparency, informed pay levels based on market insights, and more engaged employees who are aware of the skills that are valued within the organization. Additionally, it helps organizations attract, build, and retain critical skills while maintaining a performance-driven culture. The challenge lies in enhancing existing programs to include pay for skills effectively, addressing the significant opportunity area presented by the subjective nature of individual bias in pay philosophy. Objective skill assessments can help mitigate this challenge and ensure that rewards are allocated fairly based on an employee's proficiency in specific skills."

Managers need to change their mindset and behaviors to enable new ways of working and create better opportunities for learning and development based on employees' skills and aspirations. Employees, in turn, seek career growth and development opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "When these needs are aligned, it leads to a thriving talent marketplace where internal and external talent can be matched efficiently, creating better opportunities for career growth, learning, and development for the workforce. This alignment also helps organizations realize business benefits more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's essential not to underestimate or under-invest in change management when implementing a talent marketplace. Change management is the most critical factor in determining its success, as shown in Figure 3. HR plays an evolving role in this process, acting as arbitrators of conflict management and enabling the movement and flow of talent with the right processes, governance, technology, and change management.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the alignment of business, manager, and employee needs is essential for the successful adoption of a talent marketplace. It leads to early adopters who are motivated to release trapped capacity, become more future-fit through upskilling, and provide transparent career opportunities for employee retention. Change management plays a crucial role in ensuring a thriving and sustainable talent marketplace by enabling the movement and flow of talent with the right processes, governance, technology, and change management.The symptoms of a lack of alignment in a talent marketplace can hinder its success and lead to various challenges. Here are some common issues that may arise when business, manager, and employee needs are not aligned:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Low participation: When employees perceive gigs and projects as \"extra\" work or feel that their skills are not valued, they might have low participation, limited adoption, and uptake in the talent marketplace. This can lead to underutilized talent and missed opportunities for growth.\n",
      "2. Talent hoarding: Managers may not see value in rotating team members or don't know how to redesign work, leading to talent hoarding or a blocked flow of talent. This can result in missed opportunities for employees to develop new skills and grow within the organization.\n",
      "3. Low sponsorship: When employees and managers align on projects and movement, but business needs are not met, business sponsorship drops due to low return on investment. This can lead to a lack of commitment from leadership and limited resources allocated to the talent marketplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "These discrepancies can hinder upskilling and reskilling initiatives that support lateral and diagonal movements within the organization, causing talent blockages for individuals holding adjacent skills. To combat these challenges, organizations should promote consistency in skills framework and governance so that all stakeholders are using the same language. This will help lay the groundwork for skills-based decision making and equal access to opportunities.In the context of a talent marketplace, the role of HR evolves from being a connector of talent to an arbitrator or \"talent orchestrator.\" This shift is necessary as HR sets guidelines and advises leaders on how to manage the movement and flow of talent with the right processes, governance, technology, and change management.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new responsibilities for HR in a talent marketplace include:\n",
      "1. Codifying and establishing marketplace best practices for a sustainable path forward.\n",
      "2. Building manager capability to enable ways in which work can be deconstructed into tasks and turned into attractive projects that motivate and allow talent to connect seamlessly.\n",
      "3. Supporting HR teams in adopting a future orientation as their role evolves.\n",
      "4. Addressing the key \"enablers\" of leader, manager, employee, and HR effectiveness in this new way of working.\n",
      "5. Learning, evolving, adapting, and communicating with clear linkages to outcomes, purpose, and benefits.\n",
      "6. Ensuring a thriving and sustainable talent marketplace by managing conflict, enabling the movement and flow of talent, and balancing the needs of various stakeholders.\n",
      "7. Driving value more broadly and holistically for organizations and employees through initiatives like mentoring, succession planning, work demand forecasting, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest challenge in implementing and sustaining a talent marketplace is change management, as it significantly impacts ways of working, teaming, performance management, and other talent practices. To realize the full potential of their talent marketplaces, organizations must invest early in building manager capability and supporting HR teams in adopting a future orientation.Talent hoarding, which occurs when managers hold onto their best performers instead of sharing them with other teams or projects within an organization, can significantly hinder the success of a talent marketplace. This behavior can lead to several negative consequences, including blocked talent flow, reduced innovation, and decreased organizational agility.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate talent hoarding, organizations should consider implementing the following strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Establish clear guidelines and expectations: Set rules for talent sharing, such as requiring a certain percentage of new work to be posted on the talent marketplace before opening a new hire requisition. Consider including metrics on talent marketplace adoption in managers' performance scorecards.\n",
      "2. Foster a culture of collaboration: Encourage teamwork and cross-functional projects that require employees from different teams or departments to work together. This can help build relationships and trust between teams, making it easier for them to share talent when needed.\n",
      "3. Provide incentives for sharing talent: Offer performance goals or rewards that incentivize teams or business units to share talent internally. For example, teams could be recognized for their contributions to the organization's overall success or receive bonuses based on the development of underutilized skills within their ranks.\n",
      "4. Address underlying concerns: Managers may hoard talent due to fears about losing control or not being able to replace the employees they share. To address these concerns, organizations can provide resources and support for developing backup talent or offer training programs to help managers build the necessary capabilities to effectively manage and develop their teams.\n",
      "5. Encourage open communication: Create an environment where managers feel comfortable sharing their talent needs with one another. This can be facilitated through regular meetings or forums where managers can discuss their current projects, upcoming initiatives, and talent requirements. By fostering open communication, organizations can help reduce the need for hoarding and encourage more collaboration between teams."

      "Progressive firms are taking various steps to encourage their employees to stay relevant in the current job market. One of the primary ways is by helping them assess their skills portfolio against the market's needs and providing opportunities for upskilling, reskilling, or redeployment. This can be facilitated through career experience software programs that show employees the skills they need and the courses they can take to acquire them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way firms are supporting their employees is by offering financial wellbeing advice and outplacement services. These initiatives can positively impact departing employees' lives, making it a responsible approach for employers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, progressive organizations are viewing their workforce through a skills lens, recognizing their people as valuable assets with transferable skills that can be leveraged throughout the organization. They also see the potential within each employee to learn new skills and adapt to remain relevant in the rapidly evolving world of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, firms are being transparent about new roles reskilling can lead to and linking pay to the development of future skills. This not only democratizes opportunities for people but also advances diversity, equity, and inclusion by allowing employees to truly \"bank\" their skillset rather than their tenure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, progressive firms are embracing a future-focused model that prioritizes employee development, flexibility, and transparency to help them stay relevant in the current job market.Technology plays a significant role in helping employees identify their skill gaps and opportunities for advancement. Career experience software programs, such as Mercer Skills Map, show employees the skills they need to acquire and the courses they can take to do so. These programs help bridge the skills gap by mapping skills to jobs and allowing managers to determine proficiency levels for each skill. They also facilitate internal mobility by connecting talent to work and maximizing the use of existing skills within an organization before shopping for new ones externally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, technology platforms have helped democratize career development opportunities and enable a philosophy of utilizing talent across the organization. These platforms allow employees to express their skills and passions in different areas, own their careers, pursue opportunities aligned with their aspirations, and access work that's meaningful to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, AI and technology today can make assumptions about an individual's likely skills based on their job title and organizational history. While accuracy will improve over time, smart firms are acting now to recognize the potential value of skills beyond current roles and adapt to the rapidly evolving world of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "To effectively leverage technology for skill identification and advancement opportunities, organizations need to assess the impact of automation, track the supply and demand of skills externally, and link rewards to ongoing skill development. This will help create a culture that values employees as valuable assets with vital skills that can be leveraged flexibly throughout the organization as needs change.In today's rapidly changing business landscape, workforce transformation has become a necessity for organizations to remain competitive. One way technology is helping with this transformation is by improving how skills are credentialed and matching workers with new roles. However, for sustainable change, hiring managers need to evolve their mindsets while adopting new practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The traditional approach of evaluating candidates based on qualifications from learning institutions can make it difficult for those who have gained new skills online to switch careers. Therefore, it's essential for hiring managers to broaden their perspective and consider the value of skills gained through alternative means, such as online courses or self-study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, a skills-based approach to talent management allows organizations to be more agile and responsive to changing business demands. By focusing on the skills required for specific roles rather than rigid job descriptions, hiring managers can more easily match workers with new opportunities within their organization. This not only benefits the organization but also provides employees with greater opportunities for growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, a shift towards a skills-based approach requires a culture of trust and learning. Hiring managers must be open to the idea that their employees have valuable skills beyond their current role and can adapt to new challenges. This mindset shift can lead to increased employee engagement, motivation, and job satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, evolving mindsets and adopting new practices are crucial for hiring managers in the context of workforce transformation. By focusing on skills rather than qualifications, organizations can be more agile, responsive, and inclusive in their talent management strategies.Individuals face several challenges when trying to switch careers, particularly those who have acquired new skills online. One of the primary issues is that traditional hiring practices still prioritize formal education and qualifications over self-taught skills. This creates a barrier for individuals looking to make a career change, as they may not meet the standard requirements for roles in their desired field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another challenge is the lack of transparency regarding which skills are in demand and how they align with various roles within an organization. HR teams often struggle to identify the specific skills required for open positions or to understand how the skills of current employees can be leveraged to fill those roles. This results in missed opportunities for both individuals looking to switch careers and organizations seeking to optimize their talent pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technology is helping to address these challenges by democratizing career development opportunities and enabling more transparent skill assessments. Career experience software programs, for example, can help employees identify the skills they need to acquire for specific roles and provide recommendations for relevant courses or training. These platforms also allow organizations to gain a better understanding of the skills they have in their workforce, making it easier to match individuals with open positions and optimize talent utilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, technology is enabling new ways of working and teaming, such as inclusive leadership and digital collaboration. As the world continues to change at an unprecedented pace, critical skill sets will shift, and individuals will need to be adaptable and continuously upskill or reskill to remain relevant in their careers. Technology can help facilitate this process by providing real-time insights into emerging skills and enabling more efficient talent mobilization and connection to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, technology is playing a crucial role in addressing the challenges faced by individuals looking to switch careers, particularly those who have gained new skills online. By promoting transparency, facilitating skill assessments, and enabling new ways of working and teaming, technology is helping to create a more dynamic and adaptive talent marketplace that benefits both individuals and organizations."

      "The decrease in interest in tracking skills within Production, Supply Chain, and Creative & Design job families can be attributed to the increasing automation and robotization of roles in these areas. As more tasks become automated, the need for human skills in traditional manufacturing and supply chain roles may become less priority. However, it's important to note that this trend does not necessarily mean that skills are no longer valuable in these job families. Instead, the types of skills required may shift towards areas such as problem-solving, adaptability, and technical expertise related to automation and robotics. Additionally, creative roles may require a greater focus on soft skills like creativity, communication, and collaboration as technology continues to advance. Ultimately, organizations need to keep up with the changing demands of these job families and invest in reskilling and upskilling their workforce to remain competitive.The rise of automation and robotics is leading to a shift in priority when it comes to tracking human skills in traditional manufacturing and supply chain sectors. As more roles in these families become automated, the focus on skills associated with designing, managing, and maintaining automation systems becomes increasingly important. AI-based platforms can help organizations assess the impact of automation on various roles and suggest logical reskilling or redeployment options for displaced workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's essential to note that these technologies are not a safeguard against future joblessness. The World Economic Forum estimates that 85 million jobs will be displaced by automation between 2020 and 2025. An overemphasis on digital skills may leave companies tied to near-term requirements and neglect longer-term needs. Creativity, empathy, and critical thinking are areas where humans add the most value in the era of rapid world changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate the downside of being transparent about skills that are trending up or down, HR can play a crucial role in supporting greater transparency in skills, jobs, pay, and more. Predicting the skills of the future requires organizations to place a premium on both digital and human skills. Integrating skills into career development, talent acquisition, and performance management is becoming increasingly common among employers. AI-powered talent intelligence platforms can help match the supply of talent to demand for work across projects, gigs, full-time, and part-time jobs based on skills, aspirations, and availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the rise of automation and robotics in traditional manufacturing and supply chain sectors necessitates a shift in focus towards skills associated with designing, managing, and maintaining these technologies. Organizations must also invest in both digital and human skills to maintain a competitive edge and prepare for future changes.The shift towards automation has significant implications for skills tracking in HR management. With many administrative, human resources, and data entry roles becoming automated, it is less important to track traditional skills associated with these roles in manufacturing and supply chain job families. Instead, companies should focus on skills related to production, supply chain, creative & design, digital collaboration, inclusive leadership, and other skills that are less likely to be automated.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the increasing use of automation also means that HR needs to have a clear understanding of the skills in its workforce to make informed decisions about workforce planning, rewards, and performance management. This requires accurate and up-to-date data on employee skills, which can be challenging to obtain and maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address this challenge, companies are adopting various approaches such as requiring employees to complete online skills profiles or using AI to infer skills from employee data. Continuous skills data refresh is also important to ensure that the organization's skills inventory remains accurate and up-to-date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these challenges, there is a positive shift towards skills-based transformation in HR management. Many companies are integrating skills into their job architecture, conducting future-focused skills audits for critical segments of the workforce, and using technology to optimize skills data management. By focusing on the right skills and implementing effective strategies for tracking and managing them, organizations can stay ahead of the curve and adapt to the rapidly changing world of work.The skills associated with roles that design and manage automation and robots are considered in demand because of the increasing trend towards automation and robotics in various industries. As traditional manufacturing and supply chain jobs become less prioritized due to automation, there is a growing need for professionals who can design, implement, and manage these technologies. These skills include programming, systems integration, data analysis, and problem-solving abilities, among others. Additionally, as organizations continue to invest in technology to remain competitive, there will be an ongoing demand for individuals with expertise in automation and robotics."

This involves aligning skills with future strategy and identifying critical work that will contribute to the organization's long-term success. Future-proofing an organization can be achieved through various use cases such as reskilling/upskilling the workforce, unlocking trapped capacity, matching work demand with availability, responding to employee needs, and empowering employees to choose opportunities in line with their aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key aspects of future-proofing is predicting the skills of the future and investing in them before they become essential. This requires organizations to have a clear understanding of how work will change and the impact on skills demand. By doing so, they can reskill or upskill their people to be ready for the future and locate the right external or internal talent to fit future needs.\n",

They recognize that their employees possess valuable skills that can be leveraged flexibly throughout the organization as needs change. These companies also see the potential within each employee to learn new skills and adapt, ensuring their relevance in the rapidly evolving world of work. By focusing on future-critical skills, organizations can proactively identify gaps between tomorrow's business needs and today's employee capabilities, enabling them to reskill or upskill their workforce accordingly. This approach not only benefits the organization but also provides opportunities for individual employees to remain employable within the company or elsewhere.Organizations that lag behind in adapting to the future of work risk becoming obsolete. This is because the business landscape is constantly evolving, and those who fail to keep up with changing trends and skills requirements may find themselves at a disadvantage. Late adopters may have to rely on purchasing external talent as their workforce changes, which can be costly and ultimately less effective in the long run.\n",

      "The survey participants identified several barriers to implementing pay-for-skills programs, including difficulty managing the process and technology, as well as resistance to change from management and employees. Addressing these challenges is essential for organizations looking to future-proof themselves and remain competitive in a rapidly changing world.In today's business landscape, there is a growing trend towards future-proofing organizations by anticipating changes in work and the resulting impact on skills demand. This approach enables organizations to reskill or upskill their workforce, retain talent, increase productivity, and generate additional revenue (Mercer, 2021). However, balancing cost containment with the need to reshape for the future of work can be a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost containment is essential for any organization as it helps ensure financial stability and sustainability. Traditional approaches to managing costs include reducing headcount through layoffs or outsourcing work to contingent workers. However, these methods may not be effective in the long term, especially when it comes to addressing the skills gap and adapting to emerging trends in the labor market (Deloitte, 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, investing in reskilling and upskilling programs can help organizations future-proof their workforce by developing the necessary skills to meet evolving business needs. This approach not only benefits employees by providing them with opportunities for career growth but also helps companies retain talent and increase productivity (Mercer, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "To strike a balance between cost containment and the need to reshape for the future of work, organizations can consider implementing a skills-based approach. This involves assessing the impact of automation on jobs and identifying new work that is emerging to achieve the optimal combination of humans and machines (Mercer, 2021). Additionally, tracking the supply and demand of skills externally and considering their value in workforce planning and rewards decisions can help organizations make informed decisions about talent deployment and development (Deloitte, 2019).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another strategy is to tap into universal skills that are valuable across industries and valuing employees based on their skillset rather than tenure or seniority.
